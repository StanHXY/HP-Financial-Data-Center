# Financial Data Exchange Center #

## Overview ##
The High-Performance Financial Data Center is a Linux-based real-time financial data exchange center that I developed in C++. It is designed to fetch and integrate stock data from multiple sources, such as Finnhub and Yahoo Finance, for over 200 companies. The data center uses MySQL and the Federated Engine for data management.
